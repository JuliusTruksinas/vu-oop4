# Project Description

This project is a basic word and URL frequency analyzer. It processes a text file (text.txt) by removing punctuation, extracting URLs, and counting how often each word and URL appears. The results are saved in two separate files: output.txt for word frequencies and url.txt for URL frequencies.
